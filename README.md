# EmbeddedDisplay
This piece of software is meant to provide an application with a generic API to drive _any_ display one might encounter in the embedded world. It is _not_ a display driver but an implementation of the typical functionality that an application expects when directing a display. This is meant to sit in between the application and a display driver, removing the application from the low-level display driving specifics, and removing the display driver from having to support high-level functionality (e.g., computing how text should be displayed, performing rotations on the present screen, etc.).
